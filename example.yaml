# Your configuration file must have exactly one `database` section. This defines
# the connection details and credentials for the database to be scanned. For
# details on parameters, see:

# https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-dbal/en/latest/reference/configuration.html

database:
    driver: pdo_mysql
    dbname: database
    host: 127.0.0.1

    user: username
    password: password

# You optionally may define one `logger` section. This can be used to send
# detailed output to a logfile, database, or remote service. If specified, then
# you must also include at least one log handler, which should be the full class
# name of a class that implements \Monolog\Handler\HandlerInterface, and any
# required arguments for it. If you just want output on the console, skip the
# `logger` section and use a `progress` section instead.

logger:
    name: myLoggerLabel
    handlers:
        -
            handler: \Monolog\Handler\StreamHandler
            args: ['/tmp/crom.log', debug]

# A `progress` meter will output run-time details to the console. The following
# meters are available:
#
#   silent:     No output, just sets the exit status.
#   dots:       Outputs a dot for each assertion.
#   summary:    No output for individual assertions, but displays a summary.
#   fail:       Verbose output for each failed assertion, plus a summary.
#   verbose:    Verbose output for all assertions, plus a summary.

progress: fail

# Provide one or more scanners to define the assets you wish to scan.
